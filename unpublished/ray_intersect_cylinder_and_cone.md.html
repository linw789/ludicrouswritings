                **Intersect Ray with Cylinder and Cone**

Recently I was tasked to write code for detecting intersection between a ray and
various shapes, two of which are cylinder and cone. I want to take this chance
to write down some of the details that are not readily obvious and took me some
time to get right.

# Ray Cylinder Intersection 

Let's define a capped cylinder by a point $ A $ that's the center of one end
and $ D_c $ as the unit-length direction from $ A $ to the center of the other
end, and $ h, \, r $ as the height and the radius of the cylinder respectively.
We define a ray with its origin at $ Q $ and unit-length direction $ D_r $. (In
the book Real-Time Collision Detection, though he mentioned it, the author
didn't use unit-length direction to represent cylinder and ray.)

![Ray Cylinder Intersection, Figure 1](..\graphs\intersect_ray_cylinder_00.png)

We can express any point on the ray using explicit line equation with the
parameter $ t $: 

$$ PR(t) = Q + tD_r \,|\, t >= 0 $$ 

If we ignore the height of the cylinder for now, we can represent any point 
$ PC $ on the surface of the cylinder implicitly based on the definition of the
cylinder which is, according to Wikipedia, "the surface formed by the points at
a fixed distance from a given straight line called the axis of the cylinder": 

$$ |PC - (A + ((PC - A)\cdot D_c)D_c)| = r $$

The equation above is simply saying the distance between the point $ PC $ and
its projection onto the cylinder axis equals $ r $.

To get interseting points of the ray and the cylinder, we substitute $ PR(t) $
for $ PC $:

$$ |PR(t) - (A + ((PR(t)-A)\cdot D_c)D_c)| = r $$

Expand the equation:

\begin{equation}
|Q + tD_r - A - ((Q + tD_r - A)\cdot D_c)D_c| = r
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
|\vec{AQ} + tD_r - ((\vec{AQ} + tD_r)\cdot D_c)D_c| = r
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
|\vec{AQ} + tD_r - (\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c + tD_r\cdot D_c)D_c| = r
\end{equation}

Assume $ m = \vec{AQ}\cdot D_c \,,\quad k = D_r\cdot D_c $

\begin{equation}
|\vec{AQ} + tD_r - (m + kt)D_c| = r
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\vec{AQ} + tD_r - (m + kt)D_c)^2 = r^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\vec{AQ} + tD_r)^2 - 2(m + kt)((\vec{AQ} + tD_r)\cdot D_c) + (m+kt)^2 D_c^2 = r^2
\end{equation}

Because $ D_r \,,\, D_c $ are unit length, $ D_r^2 = D_c^2 = 1 $.

\begin{equation}
(\vec{AQ})^2 + 2(\vec{AQ}\cdot D_r)t + t^2 - 2(m + kt)(\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c + tD_r\cdot D_c) + (m+kt)^2 = r^2
\end{equation}

Let $ n = \vec{AQ}\cdot D_r \,,\, q^2 = (\vec{AQ})^2 $

\begin{equation}
q^2 + 2nt + t^2 - 2(m + kt)(m + kt) + (m+kt)^2 = r^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
q^2 + 2nt + t^2 - (m+kt)^2 = r^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(1 - k^2)t^2 + 2(n - mk)t + q^2 - m^2 - r^2 = 0;
\end{equation}

This is a quadratic equation of variable $ t $, and there could be two real
roots which can be calculated as following

$$ t = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - ac}}{a} $$

where $ a = 1 - k^2 \,,\, b = n - mk \,,\, c = q^2 - m^2 - r^2 $. Note, the
linear coefficient is $ 2b $.

Now we want to know how many real roots the quadratic equation has. First, let's
look at $ a $ which is $ 1 - k^2 $. Because we define that $ D_c \,,\, D_r $ are
unit length, we know if $ a = 0 $ then $ D_c \,,\, D_r $ are parallel.
Geometrically, because we know what a cylinder looks like and what a ray is, we
can easily see that if the ray is parallel to the cylinder axis and overlapping
with the cylinder surface, there is an infinite amount of intersecting points.
But the question is how we could come to the same conclusion without knowing
what a cylinder is. Put it another way, how do we know that the equation (10)
has an infinite amount of real roots? And the answer is when both coefficients
and the constant are zero. 

$$ 0t^2 + 0t + 0 = 0 $$

Yes, it's really obvious after you realize it. This also could help verify our
math deduction, which you will see later in Ray Cone Intersection section.

Before we proceed, we should eliminate some obvious cases where the ray is not
going to intersect with the cylinder. To save some typing, let's call the
cylinder end where point $ A $ is at EndA and the other end EndB.

![Ray Cylinder Intersection, Figure 2](..\graphs\intersect_ray_cylinder_02.png)  

- If $ m < 0 \wedge k < 0 $. This is to say that the ray origin is outside on
  EndA and the ray is shooting away from EndA. 

- If $ m > h \wedge k > 0 $. This is to say that the ray origin is outside on
  EndB and the ray is shooting away from EndB.

Back to the quadratic coefficient $ a $, when $ a = 0 $ we want to know if the
ray if inside, outside or touching the cylinder, which is to test the distance
between the cylinder axis and the ray against the cylinder radius. Luckily, 
that's exactly what $ c \, (q^2-m^2-r^2) $ is. 

![Ray Cylinder Intersection, Figure 3](..\graphs\intersect_ray_cylinder_01.png)  

$ q^2 = (\vec{AQ})^2 \,,\, m^2 = (\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c)^2 = (\vec{AS})^2 $, the
squared distance is $ |SQ|^2 = q^2 - m^2 $. We then could just compare $ c $ to
zero. But because we are testing for intersection between a capped cylinder and
a ray instead of an infinite long cylinder and a line, we have to consider many
more cases. Let's get to them one by one. 

- If $ c > 0 $. The ray is outside the cylinder, we don't have any intersection.

- If $ c <= 0 $. Conflate the cases of touching and inside, because they make no
  difference as far as intersecting point is concerned in our case. If there is
  an infinite amount of intersecting points, we take the entering one (when the
  ray origin is not inside the cylinder) and the exiting one. Now we want to know
  where the ray origin is regarding two ends of the cylinder and also which way
  the ray is shooting. 

    - If $ m = 0 \wedge k < 0 $. The ray origin is on EndA and the ray is
      shooting away from EndA, $ t = 0 $.

    - If $ m <= 0 $. The ray origin is outside or on the EndA, and the ray must
      be shooting towards EndB, because otherwise we would have already
      considered the case. We have two intersecting points, one entering EndA 
      ( $ t_1 = -m $ ), the other exiting EndB ( $ t_2 = -m + h $ ).

    - If $ m = h \wedge k > 0 $. The ray origin is on EndB and the ray is
      shooting away from EndB, $ t = h $.

    - If $ m >= h $. The ray origin is outside or on the EndB, and the ray must
      be shooting towards EndA. We have two intersecting points, one entering
      EndB ( $ t_1 = m - h $ ), the other exiting EndA ( $ t_2 = m $ ).

    - If $ 0 < m < h $. The ray origin is in between two ends, so there is only 
      one intersecting point, the exiting one. If the ray is shooting towards 
      EndA $ t = m $, otherwise $ t = h - m $.

Done with the quadratic coefficient, we are going to deal with the determinant 
$ b^2 - ac $. If the determinant is smaller than zero, there exists no
intersecting point. If the determinant is zero, the ray is touching the
cylinder surface tagentially only at one point $ t = \dfrac{-b}{a} $. Else the 
ray goes through the cylinder resulting in two intersecting points 
$ t_1 = \dfrac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-ac}}{a} \,,\, t_2 = \dfrac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-ac}}{a} $. 
Again, the extra complexity arise from height constraint put on the cylinder and 
direction constraint on the line. 

![Ray Cylinder Intersection, Figure 4](..\graphs\intersect_ray_cylinder_03.png)

Figure 4 shows 11 possible positions and orientations a line could be placed
relative to a cylinder. As a matter of fact, due to the symmetry of the cylinder
shape, those 11 cases are exhaustive for our purpose. To enumerate all of them, 
it's much easier to do in code than English.

~~~~~~

That's it. That's all the cases you need to test for detecting ray cylinder
intersection. However, I didn't address the floating point comparison issue
which is essential to building a robust test routine, because I myself still
need to learn how to do it correctly.

# Ray Cone Intersection

Testing for ray cone intersection and testing for ray cylinder intersection are
very similar in that they both boil down to solving a quadratic equation.
Furthermore they also share the same constraints that increases the
implementation complexity.

![Ray Cone Intersection, Figure 5](..\graphs\intersect_ray_cone_00.png)

Assume a ray's origin is at $ Q $, it has the unit-length direction $ D_r $,
and a cone with its apex $ A $, unit-length direction from the apex to the base 
$ D_c $, the cone's height and radius are $ h, r $ respectively. A point on the 
ray can be represented as $ P = Q + tD_r $. Based on Similar Triangle Property:

$$ \dfrac{|(P-A)\cdot D_c|}{h} = \dfrac{|(P-A)-((P-A)\cdot D_c)D_c|}{r} $$

\begin{equation}
|(P-A)\cdot D_c|^2 r^2 = |(P-A)-((P-A)\cdot D_c)D_c|^2 h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
|(Q+tD_r-A)\cdot D_c|^2 r^2 = |(Q+tD_r-A)-((Q+tD_r-A)\cdot D_c)D_c|^2 h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
|(\vec{AQ}+tD_r)\cdot D_c|^2 r^2 = |\vec{AQ}+tD_r-((\vec{AQ}+tD_r)\cdot D_c)D_c|^2 h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
|\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c + tD_r\cdot D_c|^2 r^2 = |\vec{AQ}+tD_r-(\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c + tD_r\cdot D_c)D_c|^2 h^2
\end{equation}

let $ m = \vec{AQ}\cdot D_c $ and $ k = D_r \cdot D_c $ 

\begin{equation}
(m + kt)^2 r^2 = (\vec{AQ}+tD_r-(m + kt)D_c)^2 h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(m + kt)^2 r^2 = (\vec{AQ}-mD_c +t(D_r-kD_c))^2 h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(m^2 + 2mkt + k^2t^2) r^2 = [(\vec{AQ}-mD_c)^2 + 2(\vec{AQ}-mD_c)\cdot (D_r+kD_c)t + (D_r-kD_c)^2 t^2] h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(m^2 + 2mkt + k^2t^2) r^2 = [((\vec{AQ})^2 - 2m(\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c) + m^2 D_c^2 + 2(\vec{AQ}\cdot D_r - m(D_c \cdot D_r) + k\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c - mkD_c^2)t + (D_r^2 - 2k(D_r \cdot D_c) + k^2D_c^2)t^2] h^2
\end{equation}

let $ n = \vec{AQ}\cdot D_r \, , \, q = |\vec{AQ}| $

\begin{equation}
(m^2 + 2mkt + k^2t^2) r^2 = [(q^2 - 2m^2 + m^2 + 2(n - mk + km - mk)t + (1 - 2k^2 + k^2)t^2] h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(m^2 + 2mkt + k^2t^2) r^2 = [(q^2 - m^2 + 2(n - mk)t + (1 - k^2)t^2] h^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(k^2 r^2 - h^2 + k^2 h^2)t^2 + 2(mkr^2 + mkh^2 -nh^2)t + m^2 r^2 - q^2h^2 + m^2 h^2 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
[(r^2 + h^2)k^2 - h^2]t^2 + 2[(r^2 + h^2)mk -nh^2]t + (r^2 + h^2)m^2 - q^2h^2 = 0
\end{equation}

Before I did my own math deduction I searched online for references and found 
that most of the relevant materials used angles to define cones, which was not 
convenient for me. I chose to use radius and height instead, only to find 
out it's the same final result, but much more involved. If we divide the 
equation (22) by $ r^2 + h^2 $ on both sides, we reach the same final equation 
as listed [here](http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/2017/01/03/intersection-of-a-ray-and-a-cone/).

As I mentioned in the section Ray Cylinder Intersection, we can utilize the fact
that when the ray is overlapping with the cone surface the coefficients and the
constant of the equation all become zero, to verify the final equation.

If the ray is overlapping with the cone surface, we know that the angle between
the ray and the cone axis ought to be the same as that between a tangent line
through the apex on the cone surface and the cone axis. This makes the
quadratic coefficient zero as shown below.

$$ \dfrac{h}{\sqrt{r^2+h^2}} = \cos\theta = D_r \cdot D_c $$
$$ \Rightarrow \dfrac{h^2}{r^2+h^2} = k^2 $$

Because the ray is overlapping with the cone surface, $ \vec{AQ} $ must be
collinear with $ D_r $, which means the angle between $ \vec{AQ} $ and the cone
axis is also the same as the one above. And therefore linear coefficient is
zero.

$$ mk = (\vec{AQ}\cdot D_c)(D_r\cdot D_c) = (|\vec{AQ}||D_c|\cos\theta)(|D_r||D_c|\cos\theta) = (|\vec{AQ}|\cos\theta)(\cos\theta) $$
$$ n\dfrac{h^2}{r^2+h^2} = (\vec{AQ}\cdot D_r)\cos^2\theta = |\vec{AQ}|\cos^2\theta $$
$$ \Rightarrow (r^2 + h^2)mk = nh^2 $$

Finally, the constant is zero too thanks to the Pythagorean theorem.  

Now we proved our deduction is correct, let's get on to the real deal and try
to find the intersection.

First, like we did for ray clinder intersection we eliminate obvious cases
where the ray is not going to intersect with the cone.

- Which is when $ (m < 0 \wedge k < 0) \vee (m > h \wedge k > 0) $, the ray
  origin is outside the cone (above the apex or below the base) and is shooting
  away from the cone, so there won't be any intersecting point.

For the case where the ray is parallel to the cone surface, $ (a = 0) $, there
are three general possibilities to test.

~~~cpp
r2 = r * r; h2 = h * h ;
a = (r2 + h2) * k2 - h2;
b = (r2 + h2) * m * k - n * h2;
c = (r2 + h2) * m2 - q2 * h2;

if (a == 0) {
    if (b == 0 && c == 0) { // ray overlapping cone surface
        // check where the ray origin is
    } else { 
        // The ray intersects the cone at only one point, 
        // calculate the parameter t of that point.
        t = (2 * b) / c;
        // Calculate the projection of the vector from the apex to that
        // intersecting point onto the cone direction.
        // s = dot(Dc, Q + t * Dr - A)
        s = m + t * k; 
        if (s < 0.0f || s > h) {
            return no_intersection;
        } else if (s == h) {
            if (m <= h) { // the ray origin not below the cone base
                return one_intersection;
            }
        } else {
            // check where the ray origin is
        }   
    }
}
~~~

![Ray Cone Intersection, Figure 6](..\graphs\intersect_ray_cone_01.png)

Another special case is when the ray intersects the cone at two same points, in
other words the discriminant is zero, $ b^2 - ac = 0 $, for which there exist
two possibilities.

~~~cpp
dicr = b * b - a * c;
if (dicr == 0) {
    if (n * n = q2) { // green lines in Figure 6, the ray goes through the apex
        // ...
    } else { // the ray touches a point on the cone surface tangentially
        // ...
    }
}
~~~

What's left are the general cases, to test which we need to first calculate the 
two real roots and compare the intersecting points' relative positions againt 
the cone, which in turn can be split into three cases.

~~~cpp
sqrt_dicr = sqrt(dicr);
tt1 = (-b - sqrt_dicr) / a;
tt2 = (-b + sqrt_dicr) / a;

if (tt1 < 0.0f && tt2 < 0.0f) { // bothe intersections are behind the ray origin
    return no_intersection;
}

// Calculate the projection of the vectors from the apex to the intersecting 
// points onto the cone direction.
s1 = m + tt1 * k; 
s2 = m + tt2 * k;

if (s1 < 0.0f) { // two yellow lines
    // ...
} else if (s1 > h) { // three blue lines
    // ...
} else { // three red lines
    // ...
}
~~~

That's it for the ray cone intersection detection. I skipped many details
because they are pretty much the same as we did for ray-cylinder intersection,
such as testing whether the ray origin is inside the cone, which is trivial and
boring.
