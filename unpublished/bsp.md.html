(#) General BSP Concept

Binary spacing partitioning tree. 


(#) How BSP works in Quake 1

- Each splitting plane contains several surfaces to be drawn.

- BSP recursion stops at leaf. 

- Unlike what Abrash said in the Graphics Programming Black Book, the recursion
  was not converted to an iteration.

- The leaf doesn't contain surface but indicate the area such as water, lava, 
  solid and empty. It's useful for collision detection.

- Test which side of a plane the view point is at
    P*N-d

- Planes behind the view camera will be not drawn thanks to frustum culling 

- Negative edge index
