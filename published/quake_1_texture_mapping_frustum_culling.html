                **Qauke 1 Texture Mapping and Frustum Culling**

It has been 5 months since I wrote a [software renderer for quake 1](https://github.com/superCleo/quake-zero). 
My plan was to write down everything I learned and implemented in that project,
which obviously didn't happen because I was too lazy. And now I almost forget
everything. I have to go back and dig through my own crappy code and esoteric 
comments to find out what's actually going on. Also now I have other things to
do, it's even less likely that plan will ever be finished. Instead I want to
just write down two things that I learned and on which I couldn't find much 
information online when I first studied the quake 1 source code. 

(##) Texture Mapping

Quake 1 was first released in 1996 when most home computers had RAM in
mega-bytes. It's very hard to squeeze games like Quake 1 into only around 20
mega-bytes and storing texture coordinates in every vertex was definitely not
the best use of that scant memory. Instead, Quake 1 stores a pair of axes and
offsets for every surface and calculates texture coordinates for vertices in
each surface on the fly. 

Imagine you stick a poster onto a wall. The pair of axes are unit vectors in
world space overlapping two adjacent edges of the poster and they serve as two
principle axes in poster's local space. And two offsets are projections of the
poster's origin on the poster's two principle axes in world space respectively.

Let's say we know the texture's u axis, v axis and the texture's origin in world
space, we can calculate the texture coordinates of a vertex by projecting that
vertex on to each axis respectively.

```
/* u_axis is in world space and has unit length, texture_origin is in world space */
float u = vector3_dot(vertex_position - texture_origin, u_axis);

/* above equation can be re-arranged into the following */
float u = vector3_dot(vertex_position, u_axis) - vector3_dot(texture_origin, u_axis);
   
/* now we take u_offset = vector3_dot(texture_origin, u_axis) */
float u = vector3_dot(vertex_position, u_axis) - u_offset;
```

We can at this point calculate texture coordinates of a vertex in world space.
However, to do [perspective texture mapping](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/perspective-correct-interpolation-vertex-attributes)
we need to interpolate texture coordinates in view space and calculate stepping
information there.

Let's define $ U_{view} \; and \; U_{world} $ are texture's u axis in view space
and world space respectively, and $ P_{view} \; and \; P_{world} $ are the
positions of a vertex in view space and world space respectively and $ C $ is
the camera's position in world space and $ R \; and \; T $ are the rotation and
translation matrix of the camera. 

(I will skip the proof of transforming directions and positions between world
space and view space. And since dot product of 2 vectors can be seen as matrix
multiplication between a one-row-three-column matrix and a three-row-one-column
matrix, we use dot product indiscriminately for matrices and vectors. And we
utilize associativiy of matrix multiplication for the following deduction.)

\begin{equation*}
U_{view} = R^{-1} \cdot U_{world} \\ 
P_{view} = (R^{-1} \cdot T^{-1}) \cdot P_{world}  \\ 
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
U_{view} \cdot P_{view} & = (R^{-1} \cdot U_{world}) \cdot ((R^{-1} \cdot T^{-1}) \cdot P_{world}) \\
& = (U_{world} \cdot (R^{-1})^T) \cdot ((R^{-1} \cdot T^{-1}) \cdot P_{world}) \\
& = (U_{world} \cdot R) \cdot ((R^{-1} \cdot T^{-1}) \cdot P_{world}) \\
& = U_{world} \cdot R \cdot R^{-1} \cdot T^{-1} \cdot P_{world} \\
& = U_{world} \cdot (T^{-1} \cdot P_{world}) \\
& = U_{world} \cdot (P_{world} - C) \\
& = U_{world} \cdot P_{world} - U_{world} \cdot C \\
\\ 
u & = U_{world} \cdot P_{world} \\
& = U_{view} \cdot P_{view} + U_{world} \cdot C \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

(##) Frustum Culling

To determine if an area is completely inside or outside of a camera's viewing
frustum, Quake 1 tests the AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) of the area against
the frustum, which boils down to testing which side of each plane of the frustum 
an AABB is at.

Because here we only want to know if an AABB is completely on one side of a
plane of the frustum, we can just test which side of a plane an extreme point
of the AABB is on. For example, to determine if an AABB is completely on the
opposite side of the plane that its normal is pointing to, we can test if the
furthest point along the direction of the normal on the AABB is on that side.
Considering a one dimenional instance:

****************************************
* -----A--------B---------C----------> *
****************************************

to determine if the segment AB is completely on the opposite side of C that its
normal is pointing to, we can test if the furthest point along the direction of
the normal on the segment AB, in this case B, is on that side.

In 3D, finding a furthest point along a direction on AABB is easy:

```
furthest_point.x = direction.x > 0 ? aabb.max.x : aabb.min.x;
furthest_point.y = direction.y > 0 ? aabb.max.y : aabb.min.y;
furthest_point.z = direction.z > 0 ? aabb.max.z : aabb.min.z;
```

But to test every area in Quake 1's BSP tree, that's a lot of branches.  And I
bet there weren't many CPUs in 1996 that had conditional move instruction.

Instead, Quake 1 uses a trick to get the furthest point directly by pre-storing
indices of AABB's min, max values based on each frustum plane's normal. For
example, we define the furthest point along a normal as reject point and the
furthest point along the opposite direction as accept point. And we combine
AABB's min and max values into one array:

```
float minmax[6] = {aabb.min.x, aabb.min.y, aabb.min.z, 
                   aabb.max.x, aabb.max.y, aabb.max.z};
```

now we calculate reject point and accept point's indices:

```
if (normal.x > 0.0f) {
    /* minmax[3] is the furthest point along the normal on x axis */
    reject_index.x = 3;
    /* minmax[0] is the furthest point along opposite direction of 
       the normal on x axis */
    accept_index.x = 0;
} else {
    reject_index.x = 0;
    accept_index.x = 3;
}

/* do the same for the other 2 dimensions 
   ... */
```

we can then, instead of doing conditional tests for every AABB, use 
`reject_index` and `accpet_index` to get the furthest points along the normal:

```
vector3 reject_point = {aabb.minmax[reject_index.x],
                        aabb.minmax[reject_index.y],
                        aabb.minmax[reject_index.z]};
vector3 accept_point = {aabb.minmax[accept_index.x],
                        aabb.minmax[accept_index.y],
                        aabb.minmax[accept_index.z]};
```
