                           **Next Smallest Power of 2**

In programming often we want the guarantee of some variables being power of 2
for reasons such as data alignment, easy masking and etc. If a variable is not 
such a number a safe solution is to find the next smallest number that meets the 
requirement.

~~~
unsigned int next_smallest_power_of_2(unsigned int x) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 31; ++i) {
        if ((1 << i) >= x) {
            return 1 << i;
        }
    }
}
~~~

The above is a naive way to achieve that. On the site [Bit Twiddling Hacks][bit_twiddling_hacks] 
the author offered a branchless method.

~~~
unsigned int next_smallest_power_of_2(unsigned int x) {
    x--;
    x |= x >> 1;
    x |= x >> 2;
    x |= x >> 4;
    x |= x >> 8;
    x |= x >> 16;
    x++;
    x += (x == 0);
    return x;
}
~~~

The author also mentioned that:

And this is the clue I used to work backward and tried to make the deduction 
myself, which at the end didn't work out. But I wrote down below the failed 
attempt anyway.

First we restate the problem in a more mathematical way.

For a given integer $ x \; (x > 0) $, we want to calculate integer $ n \; (n \geq 0) $ 
that

$$ 2^n \geq x $$
$$ 2^{n-1} < x $$

which can be transformed into 

$$ n \geq log_2 x $$
$$ n < log_2 x + 1 $$

Translate the above two equations back into English: We want a function that takes 
an unsigned non zero integer and returns an unsigned integer that's the result 
of $ log_2 x $ rounded away from zero. 

~~~
unsigned int log2_ceil(unsigned int x) {
    ASSERT(x > 0);
    // for example, log2_ceil(4) returns 2, and log2_ceil(5) returns 3.
}
~~~

Again, a naive way to achieve this is to iterate through all possible solutions.

~~~
unsigned int log2_ceil(unsigned int x) {
    ASSERT(x > 0);
    if (x == (1 << 0))  return 0;
    if (x == (1 << 1))  return 1;
    if (x <= (1 << 2))  return 2;
    if (x <= (1 << 3))  return 3;
    // ...
    if (x <= (1 << 31)) return 31;
    else                ERROR("x is too big");
}
~~~

The function `log2_ceil` looks odd in that the first two if statements are
incongruous with the others, and it contains an error case. How about
`log2_floor`? If we have a function that takes an non zero unsigned integer and
returns an unsigned integer that's the result of $ log_2 x $ rounded towards
zero, 

~~~
unsigned int log2_floor(unsigned int x) {
    // for example, log2_ceil(4) returns 2, and log2_ceil(5) returns 2.
}
~~~

then we can write `log2_ceil` as the following.

~~~
unsigned int log2_ceil(unsigned int x) {
    if (x > (1 << 31)) ERROR("x is too big");
    return log2_floor(x - 1) + 1;
}
~~~

It draws inspiration from a very common technique people use to calculate the
ceiling of an integer division.

~~~
unsigned int div_ceil(unsigned int x, unsigned int y) {
    return (x - 1) / y + 1;
}
~~~

This method can be applied to a slew of problems. For example, if we have a 
function `unsigned int square_root_floor(unsigned int)`, we can get 
`square_root_ceil` = `square_root_floor(x - 1) + 1`.

Back to `log2_floor` function, we can easily write it like this,

~~~
unsigned int log2_floor(unsigned int x) {
    ASSERT(x > 0);
    if (x >= (1 << 31)) return 31;
    if (x >= (1 << 30)) return 30;
    // ...
    if (x >= (1 << 2))  return 2;
    if (x >= (1 << 1))  return 1;
    else                return 0; /* x >= (1 << 0)) */
}
~~~

We are essentially testing all the possible values for x to get n. One way to 
optimize this is to realize that

$$ 2^n = 2^{n_1 + n_2} = 2^{n_1} \cdot 2^{n_2} \geq x $$

and since we are dealing with 32-bit integer, the larget power of 2 is

$$ 2^{31} = 2^{16} \cdot 2^8 \cdot 2^4 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^1 \cdot 2^0 $$

By decomposing the exponent we can test x against each decomposed exponent 
indivisually.

~~~
n = 0
if x >= 2^16 
    then n += 16; x = x / 2^16
if x >= 2^8  
    then n += 8; x = x / 2^8
if x >= 2^4  
    then n += 4; x = x / 2^4
if x >= 2^2  
    then n += 2; x = x / 2^2
if x >= 2^1  
    then n += 1;
~~~

Transform the above into real code.

~~~
unsigned int log2_floor(unsigned int x) {
    ASSERT(x > 0);
    unsigned int n = 0;
    if (x >= (1 << 16)) {n += 16; x >> 16;}
    if (x >= (1 << 8))  {n += 8;  x >> 8;}
    if (x >= (1 << 4))  {n += 4;  x >> 4;}
    if (x >= (1 << 2))  {n += 2;  x >> 2;}
    if (x >= (1 << 1))  {n += 1;  x >> 1;}
    return n;
}
~~~

Now the function `next_smallest_power_of_2` would look like this.

~~~
unsigned int next_smallest_power_of_2(unsigned int x) {
    if (x == 0) return 1;
    x--;
    unsigned int n = 0;
    if (x >= (1 << 16)) {n += 16; x >> 16;}
    if (x >= (1 << 8))  {n += 8;  x >> 8;}
    if (x >= (1 << 4))  {n += 4;  x >> 4;}
    if (x >= (1 << 2))  {n += 2;  x >> 2;}
    if (x >= (1 << 1))  {n += 1;  x >> 1;}
    n++;
    return 1 << n;
}
~~~

It's still quite different from the one mentioned in the Bit Twiddling Hacks,
but I couldn't proceed any further until I realized there was a much more
direct way to reason about the final solution. 

For any binary number that's not alreay a power of 2, to find its next smallest
power of 2 is to shift the leading set-bit one bit left and clear out all the
bits after it. A way to achieve that is to first set all bits after the leading
set bit and add one to the result. And to set each bit after the leading
set-bit, we can right-shift the given number one at a time and OR the shifted
number with the number before shifted each time. To make it faster, we utilizes
the fact that after every shift and OR operations we double the leading set
bits, thus the total number of shift operations is $ log_2 32 $.

I just came across this [article](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/stupid-float-tricks-2/) 
by Bruce Dawson, where he talked about floating-point numbers and gave a really
clever trick on calculating rounded up log2 of integer numbers, which is
exactly what I was trying to achieve in this blog post. With his trick our
version of next_power_of_2 now looks like this.

~~~
int next_power_of_2(uint32_t x) {
    /* Calculate log2 of x. */
    float f = (float)x; // This is the crux part.
    int n = 0;
    memcpy_s(&n, 4, &f, 4); // Convert floating-point bits to integer.
    n = n + 0x7fffff; // Round up the fraction part.
    // Extract exponent bits and offset the bias to get the real exponent.
    n = n & 0x7f800000;
    n = n >> 23 - 127;

    return 1 << n;
}
~~~

I don't think this will be faster than the one presented at the beginning,
nonetheless it's interesting to discover different ways to do things.
